## My process

### Built with

- Express
- Morgan
- Postman

### What I learned

I learned how to use Postman to test the created routes i really liked how it works,also learned about npm ,express is really helpfull to create APIÂ´s 

```js
const express = require("express");
const morgan = require("morgan");

const app = express();
const port = 3001;
//midlewares
app.use(express.json());
app.use(morgan("tiny"));
app.use(express.static("build"));

```
```js
app.get("/info", (req, res) =>
  res.send(
    `Phonebook has info for ${persons.length} people <br> <br> ${new Date()}`
  )
);
```
### Continued development

- Express 
- API
- Midlewares

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://fullstackopen.com/es/part3/node_js_y_express#middleware) - This helped me with Express. I really liked this page and will use it going forward.
